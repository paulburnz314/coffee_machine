## coffee_bot using object oriented programming

- Import class blueprints from other files
- Set up class objects for the menu, coffee maker and the money bank
- Functions are usually next but all the functions are in the class blueprints now
- Place code within if __name__ == '__main__':
- Use a while loop that keeps taking orders until the machine is turned off

- Welcome the user then show prices
- Prompt user by asking â€œ What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):
- Allow user to enter the first letter of the menu item to make an order
- Secret codes are 'off' and 'report', the report returns maker resources/ingredients and money
- Determine if what user entered is a valid menu choice
- Use the order code to determine if sufficient resources are available
- Ask user to insert money in the form of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies
- if user hits enter or enters text use a try and except to deal with error
- format currency with ':.2f'
- Determine if enough money was inserted
- Go ahead and make and serve the order while deducting resources
